				<p>
					<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:400;">
						<strong>STAGE-01: STUDY PROJECT SCOPE &amp; DOCUMENTS::</strong></span> To manage Project Procurement, it is imperative that all the project documents are thoruhghly studied and analyzed  to understand the Scope, Technical Specifications, Design/Performance Requirements, etc.
						A compreensive list of all relevant project documents is prepared and kept handy for distribution as required.  These documents include, but not limited to, Project Scope, Performance data, design data, drawings, specifications, bid queries, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:400;"><strong>STAGE-02:PLANNING STAGE - IDENTIFY PROJECT ITEMS AND DEVELOP A PROCUREMENT PLAN::</strong></span>
						 Depending on the size, complexity, and available resources, a project will be treated as either BID Package based or Bill of Materials Based. 
						 <br>&#10146; &nbsp;&nbsp;BID Package approach breaks down the project into Packages based on its Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Each such Bid-Package will form a sub-project in itself and, hence, should be awarded as a Sub-contract. 
						<br>&#10146;  &nbsp;&nbsp;Bill of Material approach is required when the project is straightforward and not very large.This is usually the case when the project is executed with In-House resources. It has to be noted that even for a Bid-Packaged type Project, certain portions will still be a Bill of Material type. 
						<span class="spacer01"></span>
						&#10022; A consolidated Bill of Quantities is prepared for the material and services required for such project and labour/other costs are added from the Project Execution team.
						From the available Project Documents, a detailed list of Bid Packages and/or Bill of quantities is generated. 
						<br>&#10022; A typical Procurement List comprise of all items that may include SUBCONTRACTS, PACKAGED EQUIPMENT, CUSTOM FABRICATED OR PRODUCED ITEMS, SPECIALIZED SERVICES, Bulk Material, etc. 

						<br>&#10022; This list is populated with the critical dates for each item, calculated from the Project Execution Schedule as the base and by estimating the total Lead Time (Duration between Ordering and Start/Completion of the delivery). The expected submittal date, order date, delivery date, are some important dates that are incorporated in this list.  Care should be taken for critical and customized items that require long time due to production, QC holdups, etc.  
						<strong>The document thus produced becomes the Project PROCUREMENT SCHEDULE.   The entire process of procurement for the project is monitored and managed in a systematic manner using this document.</strong>
						<br>&#10022; The PROCUREMENT SCHEDULE  is a dynamic document - requires constant updating with the status of each item as and when any new information is obtained as the project progresses. Special notes and remarks are documented on each item as the work progresses.   This tracking enables identifying any bottlenecks or issues that may arise and highlighting the same to the management for solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:800;">
<strong>STAGE-03: REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (REQUISITIONS): </strong></span>
Each item of the Procurement Schedule requires Quotations/Proposals from specialized vendors, subcontractors and service providers. The details provided in the RFP's (or Requisitiions) forms the basis of proposals from Vendors. Care must be taken to include all information to the vendors in order not to get incomplete or misleading proposals.
Each Requisiton/RFP file comprise of, but not limited to:
<br>&#10022; A brief Scope of work for all subcontract and major items along with a 'responsibility matrix' indicating all inclusions and exclusions in the scope.
<br>&#10022;  A Bill of Quantities for measurable contracts (For Lumpsum Contracts, the vendor will produce and submit his own bill of quantities.
<br>&#10022;  List of all drawings, specifications, technical reports, etc., that are required and to be complied along with hard or soft copies of the listed documents.
<br>&#10022;  A schedule, if available, showing earliest start &amp; completion.
<br>&#10022;  Terms and conditions of delivery, payment, inspections, installation, testing, commissioning, etc., as required.

<br>&#10022;<strong>If required by contract, the full REQUISITION files are officially submitted to client for review and approval prior to sending the same to vendors for pricing and proposals.
<br>&#10022;These Requisitions/RPF Packages are sent to approved and/or qualified vendors to provide detailed commercial and technical proposals along with listing of all deviations. Follow up is made for the proposals and all queries are responded in coordination with the client.
</strong></p>
<p>

<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:800;"><strong>STAGE-04: PROPOSAL ANALYSIS, COMPARISION AND SHORTLISTING:</strong></span>

Once proposals are received, it is logged into the list and then compared for compliance with project its deemed scope, project technical and performance requirements, schedule, terms and conditions. Clarifications are sought and obtained in order to make all proposals received for any item to be complete and comparable with one another. After due analysis of the proposals, suitable Vendors/Subcontractors are shortlisted and meetings are called for technical/commercial negotiations.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:800;"><strong>STAGE-05: SUBMITTALS &amp; APPROVALS: </strong></span>
Prior to ordering, the vendor's proposed material/service/work has to be approved by the client. In order to prepare a submittal, vendors are asked to provide technical infomraton/data sheets (NMR’s), ITP/IAP, QQ/QC documentation, Institutional Approvals, prequalification documents, etc. as may be required. The submittal is organized in a format approved or required by the client and submitted for his review and approval
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:800;"><strong>STAGE-06: FINAL NEGOTIATIONS &amp; VENDOR SELECTION: </strong></span>
Communication is established with shortlisted vendors/subcontractors by sending them targets based on analysis of all available proposals. The vendor's management/representatives are called to attend negotiation meetings with clear agenda regarding the technical, commercial and logistics of the concerned package/order. All technicalities, logistics, commercial requirements, legal matters are discussed and finalized to make the groundwork ready for the order or contract.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:800;"><strong>STAGE-07: AGREEMENT / ORDER: </strong></span>
Once the scope, terms &amp; conditions, deliverables, etc., are all finalized, a draft purchase order agreement (or subcontract agreement) is released for agreement of all parties. If required, Un-priced copies of purchase order with complete attachments (Including Requisition) are submitted to client for their review and approval. Final order is signed and acknowledged by both parties.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:800;"><strong>STAGE-8: FOLLOWUP, INSPECTIONS AND TESTING: </strong></span>
All critical requirements of the Purchase order are followed constantly. For Inspectable and special items, an Inspection Assignment Package is prepared and approved by the quality control departments of all concerned parties including client. Pre-Inspection, in-process inspection and final inspection/testing are coordinated during the execution stage of the order and inspectors are arranged to complete all inspections and witness testings where required.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:800;"><strong>STAGE-9: DELIVERY, INSTALLATION &amp; OTHER LOGISTICS: </strong></span>
Depending on the order, deliveries and execution on site are coordinated with the Project Site Management and other parties involved in the process of completing the package.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:800;"><strong>STAGE-10 WARRANTY &amp; OTHER NMR DOCUMENTATION: </strong></span>
All Non-material requirements (NMR's) as required by the contract (Design, calculations, Operation &amp; Maintenance manuals, warranty requirements, etc., are coordinated and received from the vendors prior to completion of the job.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0712bb;font-weight:800;"><strong>STAGE-11 DISPOSITION REPORT &amp; ORDER CLOSEOUT: </strong></span>
Final disposition report is prepared by obtaining all the relevant documents and the order is closed after closing all the observations &amp; comments, NCR's, etc.
